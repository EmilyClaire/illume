# illume
Illume is a web app dedicated to revealing the subconscious biases that a user may have when chatting with an anonymous person. Utilizes HTML, CSS on the frontend and integrated Google's Firebase API for chatting. A user will be allowed to input their demograhpics (white male, black female) chat with a user, and after the discussion finishes choose from a panel of demographics. Our plan is to reveal biases that we have when speaking to someone.
